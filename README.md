# WASA-Project

This is a project I made during my Erasmus mobility at Sapienza, in Rome, for the Web and Software Arhitecture course.


It is a full stack web application, with Go as the backend, Vue.js as the frontend, an openapi API document, and docker containers for deployment. The project specifications can be found in the doc folder.


I didn't have time to implement the "reactions" feature in the frontend, so I got a 28/30. There are also some other minor issues. 
For future students taking the WASA course: don't yank the code, he will ask you about it :)
